# love-eat

## About the project
I love cooking and, of course eating, so I'm building an app to have all my recipes in the same place.
The project is written in SwiftUI 2 and works on iOS 14+ and macOS 11.

## Next steps
### Firebase integration
I'm going to integrate the app with Firebase and start using Firestore as a Database.
For now I'm using mocked data hosted on this repository.

### Sharing is caring
The idea is that the app becomes social, so the next steps will be that people can create their own accounts and upload their own receipes!
